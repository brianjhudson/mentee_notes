# Mentee Notes

## About

This is simply a repo to store and share practice JavaScript problems. We will conduct our work in sessions on StackBlitz or Repl.it, but I will record our progress here.

## Installation

Currently, the only package is jest, as we might want to write tests to ensure that your solutions work correctly.

Run `npm i` and `npm test` if you would like to use these tests.

## Branches

Each mentee will have a separate branch with their initials as the branch name. As a consequence, we may not have a need for anything on the main branch.

## Questions

Contact me on Slack if you have any questions about the problems or our solutions.
