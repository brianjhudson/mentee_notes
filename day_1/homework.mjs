// 8. Loop through the properties of the house and log each one. 


// 9. Create another house object with the same properties as the first.


// 10. Create an array to store both houses.


// 11. Loop through the array and log the price of each house.


// 12. Loop through the array and log each property of each house. (That's two loops, one nested in the other.)


// 13. Write a function that takes in a house object and a property name and returns the value for that property on the house object.
