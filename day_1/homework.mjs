// 1. Declare variables for first, middle, and last names
var firstNmae = 'Nicole'
var middleName = 'Lan'
var lastNAme = 'Nguyen'


// 2. Concatenate the names and store them in a variable called fullName.
var fullName = firstName + ' ' + middleName + ' ' + lastName;
OR
var fullName = `firstName: ${firstName}, middleName: ${middleName}, lastName: ${lastName}`;


// 3. Write a function that accepts first, middle, and last names and returns a full name.
console.log(FullName); //I do n0t undertsnad this one. Can we review this?

// 4. Create an object that represents a house for sale. Give it an address, a number of bedrooms, and a sale price.
var house = {
  address:  'Indigo St',
  bedRooms: 4,
  salePrice: 450,000,
}

// 5. Console log just the price of the home.
console.log(salePrice);

// 6. Add a boolean property to the house object to represent whether or not it is in a flood zone.
isInFloodZonn: false;

// 7. Add $50k to the price.


// 8. Loop through the properties of the house and log each one. 


// 9. Create another house object with the same properties as the first.
var house2 = {
  address:  ' Fenchurch Dr',
  bedRooms: 5,
  salePrice: 430,000,
}

// 10. Create an array to store both houses.
var houses = [house, house2]
var users2 = [{}, {}]

// 11. Loop through the array and log the price of each house.


// 12. Loop through the array and log each property of each house. (That's two loops, one nested in the other.)


// 13. Write a function that takes in a house object and a property name and returns the value for that property on the house object.
